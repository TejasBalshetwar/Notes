Socketio
Creates a bidirectional connection between client and server.
Http runs on single request-response cycle, but if we want to get real-time data we have to use sockets.
Sockets have events of two types:
1) Predefined: Connect, Disconnect, Message, JSON
2) Custom events: any_name_we_want
Any data that we exchange comes into events.

Whenever we use send to transport messages we send them to a default event message we can there retrieve that message.
To send to a particular event bucket we use the emit method.
