Different types of cache:

1) Embedded cache:
Most common
mappings or reference lookups
reduce latency betn database and application
copy of data from database so we can reduce the lookups
private cache
cache is stored in the application

2) Client-Server cache:
follows client server architecture
cache is on its own instance
multiple applications can interact
shared caches,standalone cache

3) Distributed cache
to decrese the load on the cache server we create multiple cache servers which serve requests of multiple applications(clients)
low latency high volume

4) Cloud cache or CSP Managed cache
These caches are managed by the CSP itself
Example Amazon ElastiCache
It is distributed
Managed cache
Scalability

5) Reverse-Proxy cache:
cache resposnses received from the server
load balancer store the cache
API response cache
No specific maintenance

6) Side-car cache:
In kubernetes cluster there are different pods having containers
in this type of caching we store the cache in the pod alongside the container
if we have 3 pods running 3 containers, we'll have 3 cache instances in those pods
easy to containerize
low latency
app and data isolation

7) Reverse-proxy Side-car cache:
combination of both the types
containerized caches
low latency
API responses
App and data isolation
No app specific maintainence

Considerations while caching:
1) Lifetime of cached data
2) Cache eviction - remove stale information from cache
3) consistency - instantaneous, eventual
4) Priming the cache - loading and evicting processes
